CANSCAPE Version 0.8
=====================

This is a simple canvas based presentation tool in the making. The final version should resemble about 80% of Prezi. As of now this stands as a proof-of-concept of the abilities of SVG, and using simple operations like pan and zoom of the canvas.

Features:
=========
1. Ability to add simple shapes on the canvas such as a rectangle, ellipse, circle and lines. Also can add text.
2. Ability to drag and move the canvas, and its elements. Ability to zoom the canvas, alongwith the elements.
3. Select and delete individual elements.
4. Export the SVG code (Made it a little easier with a PHP script).
5. Ability to pan across the canvas using HTML buttons.
6. Click to focus on exported code.
7. Zooming of individual elements.
8. Panning using arrow keys.
9. Adding/ formatting text.
10. Colors!
11. Bring to front and move to back functionality.
12. Import an image (highly restricted as it is hardcoded to work only with my working directory...)
13. All dialogs made consistent, using jQuery UI Dialog
14. Minimal support for rotate
15. Set up the presentation path
16. New user interface, resize by dragging rectangle.
17. Ability to save the presentation
